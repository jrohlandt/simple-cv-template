Usage:

1. Copy and rename /data/sample-data.json and replace data with your own.
2. Update the json import the top of main.js to point to your data file.
3. Serve with a local webserver. E.g. python -m http.server 3000
4. Open with a web browser like Chrome and then use the print feature to save as PDF.


Tip 1: Easily tailor your cv for different roles by creating multiple data files and then just update the json import at the top of main.js.

Tip 2: If you are using VSCode, use Code Spell Checker plugin by Street Side Software to check your json for spelling mistakes.
Note: Files in data are ignored using .gitignore and Code Spell Checker automatically will also ignore those files.
To fix open the extension's settings and uncheck "C Spell: Use Gitignore".
